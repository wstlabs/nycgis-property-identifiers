Support functions for BBLs and BINs (key identifiers in the NYC property ecosystem).

Logically these functions are mostly trivial - simple stuff like tell you "is this a valid BBL/BIN"
(for certain degrees of "valid"); splitting BBLs into (and forming them out of) components, etc.  
But simple though they are, it's also easy to screw them up.  So the point of this package is 
to not screw them up.  And to have them all in one place.
